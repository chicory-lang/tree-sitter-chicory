  Some(x) => x + 1,
  None => 0
}

===================
Match with block expressions
===================

let result = match (shape) {
  Circle(r) => {
    let area = r * r * 3
    area
  },
  Rectangle(width) => {
    let area = width * 10
    area
  }
}

Match with literals and wildcards

  "hello" => "greeting",
  42 => "answer",
  _ => "anything else"
}

===================
Match in function expression
===================

let handler = (result) =>
